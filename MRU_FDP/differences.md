Key Distinctions:

1. Artificial Intelligence (Outermost Layer)
- Definition: Systems that can perform tasks without human intervention
- Real-world examples:
  - Netflix recommendation system
  - Self-driving cars
  - Smart home systems
  - Virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa)

2. Machine Learning (Second Layer)
- Definition: Statistical tools for data analysis and prediction
- Characteristics: Uses statistical methods to learn from data
- Examples:
  - Spam email detection
  - Credit card fraud detection
  - Weather forecasting
  - Product recommendations

3. Deep Learning (Third Layer)
- Definition: Neural networks mimicking human brain function
- Key components:
  - ANN (Artificial Neural Networks)
  - CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) for images
  - RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks) for sequences
- Examples:
  - Face recognition
  - Voice assistants
  - Language translation
  - Medical image analysis

4. Generative AI (Innermost Layer)
- Definition: Creates new content based on training data
- Two main types:
  - Large Language Models (text): GPT, Claude, Llama
  - Large Image Models: DALL-E, Stable Diffusion
- Examples:
  - ChatGPT generating text
  - DALL-E creating images
  - GitHub Copilot writing code
  - Midjourney generating art

Key Distinctions:
- AI vs ML: AI is the broader goal of machine autonomy; ML is the statistical approach to achieve it
- ML vs DL: ML uses predefined features; DL automatically learns features through layers
- DL vs Gen AI: DL focuses on recognition/classification; Gen AI creates new content
