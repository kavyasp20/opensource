## Key Components and Process:

1. Content Processing:
- Document chunking into manageable pieces
- Vector embedding creation for each chunk
- Storage in vector database for efficient retrieval

2. Query Handling:
- User query vectorization
- Similarity search against stored vectors
- Retrieval of most relevant content chunks

3. Prompt Construction:
- System instructions (context and role)
- Retrieved relevant content
- Original user query

4. LLM Integration:
- Combined prompt processing
- Context-aware response generation
- Natural language output

5. End-to-End Workflow:
- Input: User question
- Processing: Vector similarity search
- Enhancement: Content retrieval
- Output: Contextualized response

This architecture enables organizations to create ChatGPT-like experiences with their own content while maintaining accuracy and relevance.
